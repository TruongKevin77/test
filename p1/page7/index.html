        <p>
            If you swap to the online mode you will be put into a different instance where there are no NPC allies but there will be a new signpost in every city that lists all of the requests that other players need help with and you can join one from there or post your own request. There are two kinds of posts that a player can make, one is where the player requests help in a hunt and so players will join the host in hunting the monster. The other is where a host will post a request to hunt a monster but not participate but instead will reward the hunters with money or items. This is the only way for players to give each other items. In actual combat depending on what weapon you choose your attacks will either hit slow and hard or fast and soft, or something in between. There are also ranged weapons if melee is not your playstyle. In general however, attack speeds on all weapons are relatively slow this will force the player to choose wisely when and when not to attack the monster. You must think before you act or else you will get punished. Also all enemies in the game including large monsters will not have visible health bars. In order to determine if a monster is about to weak and about to die you must observe the monster and see if is getting tired or limps away.
