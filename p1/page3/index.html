        <p>
            Everlasting hunt is a third person hack and slash RPG that focuses on co-op. You play as a nameless adventurer that is out to become famous and remembered for generations to come. Each city will have a variety of requests for adventurers to compete such as gathering herbs or slaying beasts. You will progress from city to city as requests get harder and harder. Your ultimate goal is to eventually defeat a legendary beast that no one has taken down along with the rest of your party members. You will encounter man types of enemies from simple low level mobs to boss monsters that will take an entire party of adventurers to take down. Unlike many other games, everlasting hunt does not have a leveling system, instead once you have defeated a beast either by slaying them or capturing them you will be rewarded with parts of that beast and you can then use those ingredients to craft new and better gear so that you can take on the next beast. Going from one city to another you can interact with the people in that city and through player made dialogue choices; you can befriend different adventurers into your party. The story ends when you take down the final beast, but you can continue playing in order to unlock all possible party members from every city and to craft all the gear in the game.
