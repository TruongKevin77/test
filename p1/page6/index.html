        <p>
            The main focus of the game play is taking down large monster and beasts by either slaying them or capturing them, but before you do that you must make preparations before a hunt. You need to choose which weapon to bring (there are 14 of them), which armor to wear and what items to bring. You also need to decide on what food to eat before you go on a hunt as they can give you special buffs and effects. When you encounter one of the many large and fantastical beasts in the game it will be quite and ordeal. One of the first things you will notice with our monster design is that there movements and motions will feel very real. Even if youâ€™re hunting a dragon or rock caterpillar like monster that rolls around like an wheel, they will all feel genuine and unique. Though the monsters are not real they will move in a way that you would expect them to move, making them feel more realistic. Once you have completed the request you can carve the body of the beast for parts that can be turned into new gear. The gears stats and special effects will reflect that of the monster it came from. For example, if the armor was made up of a lava snake then the armor will have a resistance to fire attacks and might have a special ability to make you immune to walking on lava. While traveling from place to place and completing requests you can gather party members from finding them and talking to them in cities, where you have to make certain dialogue choices in order for them to join your party or during certain requests there is a chance that you can meet another adventurer out in the field and befriend them.
