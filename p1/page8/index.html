        <h2>Game World:</h2> 
        <p>
           The game world will be split into different instances based on what city you are currently in. Each city is a hub where all necessary NPCs and other things are located. Each city will have an environmental theme such as a jungle city or a desert city, where all request taken from that city will have the adventurer go out into the jungle or desert to complete the request. Of course each city will look completely different from the others, for example, the desert city will have many fantasy style camels carrying carts around and being used as transportation. There will be very Aladdin themed look to everything from the buildings to what the NPCs wear. Doing this will hopefully give the player a sense of travel from one local to the next.  Once you have unlocked a city you can freely travel to it at any time. There are no level constraints to any of the requests as there are no levels in the game but requests will have a recommended guild ranking as to warn you of how hard or easy the request <a href="../page9/index.html">is.</a>
