        <h2>Game Experience:</h2> 
        <p>
             You will be put into the shoes of a brand new adventurer and as such people will look down upon you as they think you are weak. You begin to scorn everyone around you as you slowly climb up the ladder to reach your ultimate goal. For the beginning of the game you will have a feeling of loneliness and desperateness as your character rushes to complete as many requests as possible to gain fame. Towards the middle of the game you realize that as an adventurer thereâ€™s only so much you can do alone and so you begin to look for people you deem trustworthy and capable. Over time you eventually open up and gather more people into your party and realize that there is more to life than your own personal ambition. Throughout the game, and especially when you are fighting a great beast, the music will be very grandiose. It will feel like you are truly on an adventure and pump up at the right moments and calm down in times or rest and recuperation. The monsters maybe mythical and fantastical beasts but they will all behave and move with such realism that you wish that they really existed.
